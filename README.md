Hello, I am Vainius from Kaunas, Lithuania.

I have been learning to program since the start of the annus horriblis of 2020. 
I can code in Python, SQL, JavaScript (React + Express.js) or C#.
Right now I'm mostly interested in computer science in general.

Check out my repositories and have a nice day!
